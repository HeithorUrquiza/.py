This time, he focused on understanding the network's reaction after the event, which was caused by a response failure in a voltage regulator at a power plant in Ceará. Shortly after the incident, a mechanism called Erac (regional load relief scheme) was automatically activated, which acts to ensure that problems like this do not have a cascading effect across the country. However, in the North subsystem, this protection was not enough to guarantee the restoration of the balance between load and generation at the same speed. Because of this, power in the region took longer to be restored, with some locations going up to 6 hours without power. In the electrical system, the North region includes the State of Maranhão, but leaves out Acre and Rondônia, which are part of the Midwest/Southeast system. The country is connected to the SIN (National Interconnected System), with the exception of Roraima. There are 4 subsystems, with more than 179,000 km of transmission lines, which connect like a ring, taking and receiving energy from each other. In the Southeast, Midwest, South and Northeast subsystems, Erac acted correctly and interrupted the ripple effect of shutdowns in the system, allowing 70% of the country's energy to be maintained.
