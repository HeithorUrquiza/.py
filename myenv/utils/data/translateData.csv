"SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - An unexpected amendment included in the Complementary Bill (PLP) 136/23, which had an emergency regime approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday, opens a loophole for the return of fuel taxation by the ad valorem mode, in which taxation is based on a percentage rate and, in practice, increases whenever there is a rise in prices. The proposal gives the States the possibility of deciding whether or not they want to charge ICMS on fuels using the ad rem system, with a fixed amount per liter, currently in force. In a note this Wednesday, the Brasilcom association, which brings together more than 40 regional distributors, stated that ""this could result in an increase in fuel prices for consumers"", which would be a ""retrogression"" in relation to the change made this year, as it would generate additional inflationary pressures. The text on the subject was included in the project that provides for compensation of 27 billion reais from the Union to the States and the Federal District due to the drop in ICMS collection due to changes in the incidence of the tax on fuels, electricity, communications and public transport. The urgent request for the project approved on Tuesday was presented by the leader of the government in the Chamber, José Guimarães (PT-CE). ""The PLP (project) once again links the ICMS to the price of the commodity and with that we will be able to have fortnightly increases in the tax, as happened before the edition of LC 192/22, which zeroed the collection of PIS and Cofins on fuels in 2022 and established the incidence of ICMS only once, based on a fixed rate per volume traded (ad rem)"", said Brasilcom. With the approval of the urgency regime, the project may be voted on in the next plenary sessions, which, it is feared, may occur without proper discussion of the item that threatens to increase fuel prices. Since June, the ICMS charge on gasoline is 1.22 reais per liter throughout the national territory, while in the past it varied according to the definition of the States. In the case of diesel and cooking gas, the change in the billing model -- valid since May 1 -- stipulates 0.94 reais per liter and 1.28 reais per kilo, respectively. According to Brasilcom, another negative point of the possible change is the legal certainty ""which will be violated with the approval of PLP 136/23, since the companies in the sector have already adapted to the new system"". For the association, ""the single-phase system for collecting ICMS is such an evolution that it is foreseen even in the text of the tax reform"". (By Roberto Samora and Maria Carolina Marcello)"
